# MAGIC USERS IN A DIGITAL AGE

## INTRODUCTION

Humans have lost the knowledge and belief in magic, which has left them wide open against attacks of those that are still able to use it, such as secret societies that hide in plainsight. **This is not an accident:** those that want to harm and enslave humans have deliberately conspired to weaken them by misleading them, either by flooding the bookstores with supersticious nonsense or by trying to convince people that all can be explained by the existing body of knowledge of science.

I've experienced the shocking event of having my computer hacked from the actions of a finely-crafted attack, as skillfully as the "Stuxnet" attack. That was bad, but because I'm also highly skilled with computers, it didn't look too bad because that could be addressed by simply using hardware and software that follows proper security measures. However, I began to be pestered and annoyed by ghostly forces, and that event made me aware that ghosts have an easy one-way communication with humans: **they can easily read minds.** By simply thinking something, those thoughts are reachable by them. Strategies that involve surprise attacks are unlike to work against them.

Now that there's somewhat of a truce, there is an upside from this attack: I've got a lot of useful insight from it. Even the secret society sponsoring the ghostly assault, knowing that I'm a persistent learner, a loosely-restrained scientist and a well-behaved lesser demon, tried to get me to work together in their search of knowledge by publishing videos with subtle messages asking *"we'd like to scan your brain"* and other objectionable proposals.

I can envision the other demons from these secret societies laughing at my pathetic attempts at approaching humans to alert them. They're confident that they don't have to use any force to bring me to their side, because by simply being continuously rejected, they think that I'll eventually grow tired of trying to reach out to humans and realize that my actual family in this planet are the demons. *"See? The humans aren't going to help you, so stop playing with food and come back to your family"* - is what they want to say. **But I'll prove them wrong!**

**The goal of this live book is to preserve and gather insight regarding magic so that the humans may properly defend themselves.** It will have insight from my own experiences and I'm also open to adding insight from others, as long as it's possible to verify said insight (test it). This live book is **NOT** for collecting superstitious nonsense or teenager fantasies: whatever insight that is provided must have some way of testing it, some procedure to see the observable effects from it.
