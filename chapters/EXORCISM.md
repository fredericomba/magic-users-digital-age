### REFRESHER ON GHOSTS

For ghosts, the things that you're imagining right now are visible and the sounds in your mind right now are audible, so they can invade your privacy in a way that most beings can't. **Stop and think about the implications of that.** Let me give you some insight from my own experience.

Scammers might have doubts regarding how effective their deceitful acts are working on their targets. They may wonder if the target has been deceived or is just playing along. **Ghosts, on the other hand, have no such doubts.** They can confidently tell if the target has been deceived and is unaware of it. Thus, they do know which strategies work best for each target and can even continuously adapt their approach for hardened targets.

When I began developing and experimenting with exercises and practices for becoming an "independent fast learner" at about 19 years-old, I didn't knew it back then, but became aware of it about seven years later: **I was actually practising to become a robot.** While this outcome was acceptable for the hopeless me, that was likely the reason why the children I was interacting with were utterly not interested in my Pedagogy (even though they could get impressive scores on exams if they followed it). But one upside from that choice I made is that it made me highly resistant to scammers, both alive and dead, which lead to the ghostly forces pestering me to try increasingly harder to tame me and not freak out and not make a fuss about the successful hacking attempt done on my computer.

**They have failed to tame me.** I write this at the final days of the year 2023 and even though about eight years have elapsed since that event, I still keep the hard disk that is the tangible evidence of their acts. But in their attempt, they let me know that these secret societies control numerous newspapers, radio broadcasting networks and television channels and that ghosts can do some extra persuasion for those that have hardened hearts. While reading some article that had some hidden message targeted at me, when the visual word "TRISTEZA" (Portuguese for "sadness") hit my consciousness, that was the signal for the ghost possessing me to try to trick me to believe the presented sad story, **but its sloppy work backfired.** I haven't even began to read the article (I still have no idea what that article was about), but the chemical reactions that messed up the molecules dissolved in my blood started from my heart and lead to the sensation commonly associated with "anguish", but didn't spread to my body, so I was in the strange situation of having "sadness" in some parts of my body and not on others. **This was the key moment that lead me to understand that "emotion" and "sensation" are different things.** Recently, a few days ago, I once again experienced the strange and poorly understood phenomena of having the left side of my body acting as if it's afraid of something while the right side of my body is alright and fine. 

### INTRODUCTION

If you have any addiction, it is highly likely that you're under the influence of some ghost. They have probably tamed you and you might not even be aware of it. For using "contract magic", it is more advantageous to get rid of spiritual beings that are not involved parties, so "exorcism" precedes that procedure.

The thing called "emotion" are the responses that the will (soul) create against the environment: "fear" is the defensive response of the will against a threat, "anger" is the aggressive response of the will against a threat, "depression" is the capitulation response of the will against a threat.

The thing called "sensation", sometimes mistook for "emotion", is the information from the chemical molecules dissolved in the blood. They signal "hunger" so that the person may walk towards food and eat it and then suppress the signal. They signal "disgust" so that the person may avoid the potentially poisonous target of disgust. **Notice that these signals are used to nudge people towards some behavior.**

The people that grow addictions fail to understand that the chemical molecules in the blood are just a signal, a symbol that the body uses to communicate with the soul (and possibly vice-versa). Like any other signal, these can be faked (effects of some drugs, possession by lesser demons or hungry ghosts), so **disciplined people must learn to ignore the signals given by one's own body.** Even when having the sensation of hunger, a disciplined person, knowing that enough has been eaten already, must ignore that sensation and fast.

Be aware for the fact that possessing ghosts can mess up the composition of the blood, evoking sensations that mislead the target into tricking its own emotions: the possessing ghost wants the target to dislike something, so it will create chemical molecules that signal "disgust" so that the target grows a Pavlovian response against that something. It's a cheap technique for deceiving people, since by changing something as negligible as trace amount of chemical molecules in the blood, great effect of deceit can be achieved.

### PRINCIPLE

This is one approach that regular people can use for exorcising unwanted ghosts from themselves:

- **Identify what the possessor (guest) wants.** The perception of someone being possessed (host) slightly change and things once invisible becomes visible. As an example, a vengeful hungry ghost that was murdered by the agents of a secret society might evoke in the host the sensation of hatred when symbols of said society are reflected in the host's eyes. These insights are useful for continuously getting a better picture of the intention of the possessor (guest).

- **Persistently deny what the guest wants.** If you're overweight and can't stop eating, that might be due to a simple lack of discipline of your own, might may be made worse by multiple gluttonous ghosts that are messing up with your blood by creating chemical molecules that signal hunger even though you've eaten more than enough. By continuously fastening and ignoring hunger while doing so, the gluttonous ghosts will eventually realize that you're not going to help them in their desire for tasting food and will beging looking for another host that lacks discipline and will do their bidding.
