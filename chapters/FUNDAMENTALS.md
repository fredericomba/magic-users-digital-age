# MAGIC USERS IN A DIGITAL AGE

## FUNDAMENTALS

### DISCIPLINE

Like in every other trade, the first lesson should be "safety at work". For magic users, that is "discipline". **Discipline is the indispensable skill that all magic users must have, continuously hone it and keep it sharp.** Those that venture in magic without having it easily and quickly destroy themselves. In particular, when using "contract magic", both the will and thoughts of the host and guest are mixed and hosts that lack discipline might be tricked into submission by guests. One common example of people that met such misfortune are **addicted people**, where a ghost successfully "steals" the body of someone through trickery (messing up with the blood composition to tame said someone when behaving as the ghost expects, just like someone gives treats to a dog when behaving as expected). Beyond addictions, many other psychological disorders can be caused by ghost possession. These will be discussed in another chapter.

#### DISCIPLINE OF THE WILL

Have you ever handled misbehaving small children that, once they want something, they just go ahead and grab it? These children don't even stop to think about the side effects of their actions, which may create a growing pile of problems over time. People like this are vulnerable to traps, since even the simplest bait is enough for making them move in the way intended by the trapper. Magic usage is full of traps, so discipline of the will greatly helps on dodging and avoiding them.

The goal of practicing "discipline of the will" is being able to deny one's own will when needed, and there are many situations where this comes useful:

- for avoiding traps: by being able to ignore attractive and luring baits, one can avoid them.
- for the sake of someone else: the time spent helping someone else is a time not spent helping oneself.

##### EXERCISE: IDLENESS

There are people that are always excited to do something that even staying idle, for as little as one minute, can be unbearable for these people. **If you can't wait quietly in the lobby for your turn, this exercise is for you.** 

For this exercise, you'll need a chronometer (most mobile phones have one these days), the time to stay idle and some place where others will not disturb you while you do nothing at all. Set up the chronometer for some time duration and then wait patiently for the countdown to raise the alarm signal. Progressive increase the time duration (one minute, two minutes, five minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, two hours, six hours, twelve hours) as you practice.

**You'll know that the exercise is having the intended effect once you're able to wait and not feel bothered by it.**

##### EXERCISE: FASTING

There are people that eat food not because they need, but for whatever immediate pleasure that the food may provide them. **If you are overweight or always eager to eat, this exercise is for you.**

This exercise consists of increasing the time between eatings, so that the person grows able to eat only when needed and also only the needed amount. If you are continuously looking for snacks, cut that out while you're practicising fasting (since they'll significantly shorten the time between eatings). Try an increasing amount of time between eatings: four hours, eight hours, twelve hours, one full day. **You might be able to stay one whole day without eating and not die or collapse,** so it's alright to ignore hunger even if you are sensing it. You'll know over time if you are eating below or above the target based on how much you get fatter or not.  Once you get to the part of breaking the fast (breakfast), make sure to put on the plate only enough for nourishing yourself so that the effort of fasting isn't wasted with sudden burts of gluttonous eatings. If you're really unable to control yourself or are afraid that you might collapse of hunger and die forgotten, have a friend help you by standing by and reminding you to not eat if you begin acting as if you're about to (reaching for some snack, walking towards the refrigerator).

**You'll know that the exercise is having the intended effect once you're able to stay long periods (twelve hours, one day or more) without eating and not be bothered by it.**

#### DISCIPLINE OF THE MIND

Have you ever heard someone give a speech and contradict oneself on multiple occasions on the same speech? There are people that do not stop and think about the internal contradictions that the various beliefs they've collected over time have, or they may use a picture of reality that no longer matches what things are right now, so these inconsistencies appear spuriously when reality forces the person to think about them. Magic usage is full of confusion, so discipline of the mind greatly helps on not stalling decisions on critical moments.

There are many reasons why the body may tremble when someone is facing a threat, but in my case, I realized that working on internal coherency greatly reduced the tremor to the point of extinguishing it for some scenarios (and "full robotness" extinguishes it for all scenarios, *but that might not be the solution for everything*). I'll either run away and flee or stay and fight back (unlike before, where I considered both options and my body tried to move both ways and then did neither), so when reality forces me to make a decision, I will use one of the numerous plans I've thought in advance and decide using that.

##### EXERCISE: LOGIC PUZZLES

There is a kind of exercise that consists of a text that explains some story but doesn't give right away the full picture to the reader. However, through reasoning, the pieces that make that picture slowly are revealed and the answer appears. These exercises help on growing an organized and coherent mind.

##### EXERCISE: SYMBOL REFLECTION

There are people that, once hearing pejorative remarks regarding their mother, become full of anger to an extent that makes them dangerous to those nearby. This can be a vulnerability rather than an advantage, because it makes the person susceptible to provocations. **It is thanks to a successful provocation that I've managed to trick those that have tampered my computer into exposing themselves through attacking me back,** so you can see the use of that from this situation. Had that provocation been ignored, this live book likely wouldn't have been possible.

The exercise of "symbol reflection" consists of understanding how oneself would react given various situations. Think of the various likely  situations where you may be targeted and see how you'd react and think of the shortcomings of your present approach and how to patch them. **Beware that, overdoing this exercise can grow into paranoia.** 

### SCIENCE

As strange as it may sound, **magic is making things happen by simply wishing for them to happen.** Your act of existing is evidence of magic. You wish for your hand to move and it does, right? You wish for your legs to move you and they do, right? Your wish makes things happen, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: **because you have wished for it to happen, it happened.**

This always holds true in your mostly private room called "imagination", but in the shared space called "reality", things are a bit more complicated. If you are playing a competitive game with someone else, both your will and the will of your opponent clash. For your wish of winning to happen, the wish of your opponent to win must not happen and vice-versa.

Because of the utter lack of research and repeatable experiments on this, what follows is mostly guesswork that makes sense and aims to be coherent with the current knowledge of Physics and Chemistry. There should be an energy called "willpower" that moves the uncertainty that exists within nature according to the wish of its owner and is consumed as the wish becomes true. I have felt unusually physically tired to the point of collapsing to bed at some moments while resisting the ghostly assault, even though I wasn't doing any exercise and stayed indoors for most of the time. The ghosts were trying to mess my blood, while I was wishing for my blood to behave, so the clash of our wills led to both of our willpower to be spent in the process. My heart rate defensively decreased to slow the spread of chemical molecules on my body to a point that made my heart look like it was going to stop and led to intense pain inside of my head. The pain was so intense that I began to understand why the "mad cow disease" is so lethal: it was so unbearable that I seriously considered bending over and running toward a wall to make it stop, just like mad cows do. **I haven't done so, as I'm not willing to help my enemies like that and I'm willing to bear pain indefinitely to continue my struggle against them.** I just stopped and then began doing exercises to force my heart rate to increase, which mitigated the pain. Later, I've also got access to "risperidona", which can dangerously increase the heart rate. I disregarded the instructions from the psychiatrist, because the indicated dose of two pills was excessive, while half a pill was enough for me and eventually no pill at all was enough.

**In retrospect, I was wasting willpower.** I should have ignored the signals in my blood and let the ghosts waste their willpower on me. Now I understand how to use the natural flow of things to my advantage and **make the maximum amount of things happen while using the minimum amount of willpower.**

One of the uses of "contract magic" is to augment the amount of willpower to make things happen. **When you're alone by yourself, there's only your own willpower to make wishes come true, but when you're possessed by ghosts that share the same goal as your own to some extent, there's more willpower available.** At the year 2018, I've decided that I had collected enough information about these secret societies and their *modus operandi*, so I decided to simply not give them the opportunity to further bother me with echoes and subtle threats by not watching television, not reading newspapers, not listening to radio and so on (one of the best decisions of my life, I recommend the same for you). **At this point in time, I've realized I had developed a trait I did not had before: "tamed blood".** One of the embarassing things that many men face is to have their animal intentions so openly displayed by protuberances on their pants. Even though they may wish for it to disappear on situations where they'd rather have it hidden, it doesn't. Yet I'm able to do it with "tamed blood" by simply using willpower to force my blood to behave. I'm not sure how this happened, but the exercises that the assaulting ghosts put me to and the extra willpower that possessing ghosts give me may play a role on that. **Blood, liquids and other fluids are full of uncertainty and may be useful on coming up with exercises and experiments to study magic.**
