# MAGIC USERS IN A DIGITAL AGE

## FUNDAMENTALS

### DISCIPLINE

Like in every other trade, the first lesson should be "safety at work". For magic users, that is "discipline". **Discipline is the indispensable skill that all magic users must have, continuously hone it and keep it sharp.** Those that venture in magic without having it easily and quickly destroy themselves. In particular, when using "contract magic", both the will and thoughts of the host and guest are mixed and hosts that lack discipline might be tricked into submission by guests. One common example of people that met such misfortune are **addicted people**, where a ghost successfully "steals" the body of someone through trickery (messing up with the blood composition to tame said someone when behaving as the ghost expects, just like someone gives treats to a dog when behaving as expected). Beyond addictions, many other psychological disorders can be caused by ghost possession. These will be discussed in another chapter.

#### DISCIPLINE OF THE WILL

Have you ever handled misbehaving small children that, once they want something, they just go ahead and grab it? These children don't even stop to think about the side effects of their actions, which may create a growing pile of problems over time. People like this are vulnerable to traps, since even the simplest bait is enough for making them move in the way intended by the trapper. Magic usage is full of traps, so discipline of the will greatly helps on dodging and avoiding them.

The goal of practicing "discipline of the will" is being able to deny one's own will when needed, and there are many situations where this comes useful:

- for avoiding traps: by being able to ignore attractive and luring baits, one can avoid them.
- for the sake of someone else: the time spent helping someone else is a time not spent helping oneself.

##### EXERCISE: IDLENESS

There are people that are always excited to do something that even staying idle, for as little as one minute, can be unbearable for these people. **If you can't wait quietly in the lobby for your turn, this exercise is for you.** 

For this exercise, you'll need a chronometer (most mobile phones have one these days), the time to stay idle and some place where others will not disturb you while you do nothing at all. Set up the chronometer for some time duration and then wait patiently for the countdown to raise the alarm signal. Progressive increase the time duration (one minute, two minutes, five minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, two hours, six hours, twelve hours) as you practice.

**You'll know that the exercise is having the intended effect once you're able to wait and not feel bothered by it.**

##### EXERCISE: FASTING

There are people that eat food not because they need, but for whatever immediate pleasure that the food may provide them. **If you are overweight or always eager to eat, this exercise is for you.**

This exercise consists of increasing the time between eatings, so that the person grows able to eat only when needed and also only the needed amount. If you are continuously looking for snacks, cut that out while you're practicising fasting (since they'll significantly shorten the time between eatings). Try an increasing amount of time between eatings: four hours, eight hours, twelve hours, one full day. **You might be able to stay one whole day without eating and not die or collapse,** so it's alright to ignore hunger even if you are sensing it. You'll know over time if you are eating below or above the target based on how much you get fatter or not.  Once you get to the part of breaking the fast (breakfast), make sure to put on the plate only enough for nourishing yourself so that the effort of fasting isn't wasted with sudden burts of gluttonous eatings. If you're really unable to control yourself or are afraid that you might collapse of hunger and die forgotten, have a friend help you by standing by and reminding you to not eat if you begin acting as if you're about to (reaching for some snack, walking towards the refrigerator).

**You'll know that the exercise is having the intended effect once you're able to stay long periods (twelve hours, one day or more) without eating and not be bothered by it.**

#### DISCIPLINE OF THE MIND

Have you ever heard someone give a speech and contradict oneself on multiple occasions on the same speech? There are people that do not stop and think about the internal contradictions that the various beliefs they've collected over time have, or they may use a picture of reality that no longer matches what things are right now, so these inconsistencies appear spuriously when reality forces the person to think about them. Magic usage is full of confusion, so discipline of the mind greatly helps on not stalling decisions on critical moments.

There are many reasons why the body may tremble when someone is facing a threat, but in my case, I realized that working on internal coherency greatly reduced the tremor to the point of extinguishing it for some scenarios (and "full robotness" extinguishes it for all scenarios, *but that might not be the solution for everything*). I'll either run away and flee or stay and fight back (unlike before, where I considered both options and my body tried to move both ways and then did neither), so when reality forces me to make a decision, I will use one of the numerous plans I've thought in advance and decide using that.

##### EXERCISE: LOGIC PUZZLES

There is a kind of exercise that consists of a text that explains some story but doesn't give right away the full picture to the reader. However, through reasoning, the pieces that make that picture slowly are revealed and the answer appears. These exercises help on growing an organized and coherent mind.

##### EXERCISE: SYMBOL REFLECTION

There are people that, once hearing pejorative remarks regarding their mother, become full of anger to an extent that makes them dangerous to those nearby. This can be a vulnerability rather than an advantage, because it makes the person susceptible to provocations. **It is thanks to a successful provocation that I've managed to trick those that have tampered my computer into exposing themselves through attacking me back,** so you can see the use of that from this situation. Had that provocation been ignored, this live book likely wouldn't have been possible.

The exercise of "symbol reflection" consists of understanding how oneself would react given various situations. Think of the various likely  situations where you may be targeted and see how you'd react and think of the shortcomings of your present approach and how to patch them. **Beware that, overdoing this exercise can grow into paranoia.**
