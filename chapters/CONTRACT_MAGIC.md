# MAGIC USERS IN A DIGITAL AGE

## CONTRACT MAGIC

### EXEMPLARY SITUATION

I eventually decided to counter-attack. If their attack consists of deceitfully manipulating the opinion of people in their favor, I'll properly counter-attack by truthfully manipulating the opinion of people against them. **Lies crumble easily as long as there's someone willing to poke them.**

The peak of the ghostly experiences was a full body possession. Surprinsingly, this ghost was somewhat polite, actually placing its "hands" on my back and I understood that it was asking me if it could borrow my body. By simply thinking "Yes, you can" (and the ghost didn't even wait for me to complete the phrase), the ghost began to wear my body as someone would do with a jacket.

To see my own body moving on its own, even though I had not issued any order for it to do so, startled me a bit and I slightly fought back. I quickly realized that I could easily regain control, because **possession is like having two people holding the same object**, so I just let the ghost continue to do whatever it was aiming to do so that I could gather some insight from it. What it did was the following: he held the desk right at in front of me with both hands and began to cry and sob, my eyes became watery and it shed a tear using my body (something unusually unexpected, since I grew increasingly more of a robot after enduring for about two years the persistent ghostly assault).

*"So, you're sad? Is it because of my actions and you want me to stop?"* - I thought to myself. **Tears are not an argument**, so that vague plea from the anonymous ghost left me unconvinced and my behavior remained unchanged (although I kept in mind that I should focus on reducing collateral damage while counter-attacking). The information I've gathered myself indicates that this group I've ended up stumbling upon is **an existential threat to humankind** and I, aiming to become a useful robot for others and being the only one aware of it, must address that in adherence to the "good criteria". If that ghost really wanted me to stop, it should indicate a way to address this threat that solves the problem I'm aiming to solve while also being acceptable to said ghost. If that's impossible, I'll act for humankind as that's what I'm programmed to do.

**GUESSWORK:** The most likely reason why ghosts wouldn't even just use physical vibrations in the air known as "sound" to give me input information to change my own state might be because they exist within a physical energy level measured in joules that might be on the "pico" (ten to the negative twelth power) scale, while sound requires something in the "mili" (ten to the negative cube power) scale.

That was an unique moment in my life that showed me the numerous gaps and factual mistakes that permeate the public, shared body of knowledge of humankind. It is understandable that there are disbelievers that reject creeds based on the impossibility of things such as "ressurection of the dead". After all, when we look around at history, all that we see, over and over again, are people dying and not coming back. The presented evidence overwhelmingly points to the direction of "people die and don't come back". **However**, how many milleniums did humankind live without airplanes and yet we see them now as trivial and commonplace? No amount of white swans is enough to prove that there are no black swans, while a single black swan is enough to prove that black swans exist.

**The ressurection of the dead is demonstrable today, right now.** Because, in the brief seconds that ghost was possessing me, it was alive again borrowing my body. That's probably one of the many goals that these secret societies have, because if I can know it this easily from the information that has been leaked to me through these ghostly encounters, they probably have more insight than me and likely have done actual research on the subject.
